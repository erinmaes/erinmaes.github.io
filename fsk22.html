<h3>I kicked off my epic Florida trip by spending a few hours at FSK. I loved every minute at this park.</h3><br>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>After spending some time flying, I visited Fun Spot from 4:45PM-8:15PM. A 20-minute downpour briefly shut down the rides about halfway through my visit. I rode Mine Blower 8 times, Hurricane 4 times, Galaxy Spin twice, and Kiddie Coaster once. There were no waits while I was there, but it did look like it got busier as I left the park. The Fun Spot parks offer great value, nice employees, reasonable park policies, and generally clean walkways and surfaces. I will say that at the Kissimmee location, it was a bit strange having to walk through Old Town to reach some of their rides. Doing so required me to mingle with some people who weren't traditional theme park goers. I am glad that the extra attractions exist though! Fun Spot uses a wristband system, and will scan each rider's before loading most of the time.</p>

<br><h2>Coasters</h2>
<p> Gravity Group's <b>Mine Blower</b> is such a unique wooden coaster. It has a good drop and several airtime moments. I love that the inversion is drawn out and in a prime location. However, this coaster is much rougher than Switchback and the retracked Boardwalk Bullet, which are both older. Mine Blower is still somewhat re-rideable though, as I rode it eight times but attribute a headache to it. The valleys were the roughest parts, and rattled my whole body. I rode in all rows but row 3. My favorite seat was the back left. This coaster has a solid, unique layout but suffers considerably from roughness.  <br><br>

Simply put, <b>Hurricane</b> is not my kind of coaster. It is an experience characterized by very abrupt turns and airtime. I bumped my legs several times even when I attempted to brace. I do like the large drops on this ride and prefer the front row.<br><br>

I don't have many comments on <b>Galaxy Spin</b> or <b>Kiddie Coaster</b>. Both coasters were typical.

</p>

<br><h2>Other Rides</h2>
<p>I rode the Old Town ferris wheel once, mainly for the view. This attraction is included with the Fun Spot wristband and operated by FSK employees. I had hoped to ride Hot Seat as well, but it was dismantled. Fun Spot has rides for children, typical fair rides, go-karts, and some thrilling flat rides. </p>

<br><h2>Food & Merchandise</h2>
<p>I had a small pepperoni pizza inside the arcade building for dinner. I also purchased a souvenir drink cup. My total was $19. I highly recommend buying the refillable cup. It costs $11 with tax and is valid at all Fun Spot locations for the whole year! On just this visit to FSK, I filled the cup six times. </p>

<br><h2>Cost</h2>
<p>Since I had planned to visit all three Fun Spot locations in 2022, I purchased a season pass last November for $85. Check out the cost breakdown of my entire trip <a href="flcost22.html" style="color: #27F5CA;">here</a>.</p>
