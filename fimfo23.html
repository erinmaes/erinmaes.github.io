<h3>Before heading to San Antonio, I spent a few minutes at this campground to ride my first alpine coaster.</h3><br>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>My visit to this place lasted about 30 minutes, from 1:15PM-1:45PM. I waited in a 10 minute line to check in at the general store, rode Cliff Carver, walked around some, and left. While I'm no expert on campgrounds, Camp Fimfo seemed clean and family-friendly. The coaster employees seemed genuinely excited to work there. Although this place is only located about a 50 minute drive from San Antonio, I don't anticipate being back for a long time.  </p>

<br><h2>Coaster</h2>
<p>My first-ever alpine coaster, <b>Cliff Carver</b>, ran about as I expected. It has forces and speeds that are comparable to those of a typical mine train. I enjoyed riding alone and the hand lever was easy to use. The ride was very scenic, providing great views of Hill Country. I appreciate the longer-than-a-mile duration, but most of that is spent ascenfing the three lift hills. Cliff Carver features some quick direction changes and two brief instances of airtime. I was happy to experience a mountain coaster, but I found it only a little thrilling. When I boarded the ride, there was no line. However, when I left Camp Fimfo, the queue looked to be about a 20 minute wait. Potential riders can find out more information about the required waiver and height/weight/age restrictions on <a href="https://campfimfo.com/texas-hill-country/adventures/mountain-coaster" style="color: #27F5CA;">Cliff Carver's website</a>. I purchased my ticket in advance, but it seemed like most people bought tickets just before they rode.  </p>

<br><h2>Other Rides</h2>
<p>There aren't any traditional amusement park rides here. There is a small waterpark, and other "adventures" like a zipline.</p>

<br><h2>Food & Merchandise</h2>
<p>I didn't purchase food or merch at this place, but they have dining locations and shops.  </p>

<br><h2>Cost</h2>
<p>A ride on Cliff Carver costs $20 per person. Discounts are given for multiple riders if they share a sled. While I'm always happy to support off-the-beaten-path small parks and coasters, $20 for a single ride is pricey. I paid less per ride at Disney World last summer. </p>
