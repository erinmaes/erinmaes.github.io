<h3>Legos were an important part of my childhood and might've contributed to my decision to pursue a STEM career. Thus, I included this park in my trip. While the coasters weren't impressive, the impressive sculptures alone were worth the visit!</h3><br>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I visited Legoland after <a href="pp22.html" style="color: #27F5CA;">a brief stop at Peppa Pig Theme Park</a> from 10:30AM-5:30PM. My coaster totals were 4 on Dragon, 2 on Coastersaurus, 2 on Great Lego Race, and one on Flight School. I enjoyed viewing the Lego sculptures more than riding the rides. It's impressive that such enormous structures are hand-built from Lego bricks. I wonder how they are weather-proof and kid-proof. Coaster-wise, this park is totally skippable if the 4 credits (or 5 including Daddy Pig across the parking lot) aren't tempting. It's a hike from Orlando and Tampa. I spent $150 on just the roundtrip Lyft. Plus, admission isn't cheap and Legoland has limited operating hours (10-6 on the day I visited). Interestingly, I actually spent more time here than at Universal Studios Florida, due to 2 hours of weather delays and 30 minutes of shopping. Guests of Legoland should be prepared to encounter lots of little kids. </p>

<br><h2>Coasters</h2>
<p> <b>Flying School</b> was terrible. It was probably the roughest ride of the trip. I liked the theming on <b>Dragon</b>, although I couldn't follow the story. <b>Great Lego Race</b> is just a standard wild mouse clone with cool vehicles. Unfortunately <b>Coastersaurus</b> didn't have airtime, laterals, or speed. What it did have was a very long line. There weren't many thrills on any of these rides. On the bright side, families will enjoy this coaster collection!

</p>

<br><h2>Other Rides</h2>
<p>I rode Lost Kingdom Adventure, Merlin's Challenge, and Masters of Flight. While I prefer Soarin' for being more realistic and appealing to all ages, I enjoyed Masters of Flight a lot. It might be my favorite ride at Legoland since the coasters are so tame. The Ninjago ride also gets praise, but skipped it since I had my fill of dark rides between LKA earlier that day, Disney and Universal. </p>

<br><h2>Food & Merchandise</h2>
<p>I bought a chicken sandwich and fries, and a drink at Kickin' Chicken for $17. I really appreciated being able to refill my fountain drink for free. At the Big Shop, I purchased 3 t-shirts, a mug, and a salt and pepper shaker set for $97 total. Most of this haul was for family members. The Big Shop had a great variety of Legos, apparel, trinkets, and other souvenirs. </p>

<br><h2>Cost</h2>
<p>I bought a Legoland and Peppa Pig combo ticket from CityPass for $103 total. Buying directly from Legoland's website would've cost $21 more, so I opted for the third-party option and had no issues. Check out the cost breakdown of my entire trip <a href="flcost22.html" style="color: #27F5CA;">here</a>.</p>
