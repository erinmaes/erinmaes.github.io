<h3>After going to some very busy parks, spending time at another Fun Spot location was a welcomed change from crowds, toddler meltdowns, and long walks.</h3><br>


<br><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I visited FSO on June 8 from 5:30PM-9:30PM and June 13 from 11:30AM-1:30PM. My coaster totals were 25 on White Lightning, 3 on Freedom Flyer, and 1 on Sea Serpent. This park has similar vibes to the Fun Spot in Kissimmee, but is not broken into two sections and has metal detectors to enter. While I prefer the coaster collection at FSK, FSO has the better location. There are also more go-kart tracks. Like FSK, wait times are pretty much nonexistent here. I am also happy that the Fun Spots are open until midnight, which is usually 2 or 3 hours later than the big parks.</p>

<br><h2>Coasters</h2>
<p> <b>White Lightning</b> has a similar thrill level and experience to Switchback at ZDT's. I prefer Switchback for its superior drop and restraints. On White Lightning, areas that have yet to be Titan-tracked are bumpy, namely the double up/double down, and the final hundred feet or so into the brake run, starting with the right turn. The parts of the layout that have Titan track are very smooth.I rode in all rows, and slightly like the back more than the front. At 25 rides, this GCI now takes the title of my most-ridden coaster. It's an enjoyable woodie with several airtime moments for families and thrillseekers alike, but is a bit bumpy. So far, Mine Blower is still my favorite coaster at a Fun Spot park.  <br><br>

<b>Freedom Flyer</b> was a lot better than similar Vekoma family coasters with those bulky restraints. I'm talking about Kiddy Hawk, Flying Ace, and Flying School. On Freedom Flyer, I did not have to ride defensively and could enjoy it. It's in a great location too, and pulls decent forces near the end of the ride. I elected to re-ride this coaster a couple times since it didn't beat me up. I wish the old Vekoma family coasters could get the restraints that Freedom Flyer has.<br><br>

No comment on <b>Sea Serpent</b>.

</p>

<br><h2>Other Rides</h2>
<p>I rode FireCracker, Hot Seat, Liberty Swing, and Rip Curl once each. I liked <b>Hot Seat</b> the most, but wish it were longer. We only got two full swings before it ended. FSO also has fair rides, kiddie rides, and go-karts. There is a lot of overlap with the rides st FSK. </p>

<br><h2>Food & Merchandise</h2>
<p>I bought chicken tenders and fries from Kluckee for $11, and a huge piece of pizza from Sbarro for $5. I used my souvenir cup 8 times across my two visits to FSO. Combined with FSK, each fill cost me less than 80 cents. I love visiting the Fun Spot parks and not being gypped when it comes to food and drink. </p>

<br><h2>Cost</h2>
<p>Since I had planned to visit all three Fun Spot locations in 2022, I purchased a season pass last November for $85. With three total visits to the Florida Fun Spots, admission cost me $28 each time. </p>
