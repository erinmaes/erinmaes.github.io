<h3>After going to some very busy parks in Florida, spending time at another Fun Spot location was a welcomed change from crowds, toddler meltdowns, and long walks.</h3><br>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I visited FSO on June 8 from 5:30PM-9:30PM and June 13 from 11:30AM-1:30PM. My coaster totals were 25 on White Lightning, 3 on Freedom Flyer, and 1 on Sea Serpent. This park has similar vibes to the Fun Spot in Kissimmee, but has metal detectors at the entrance and is not broken into two sections. While I prefer the coaster collection at FSK, FSO has the better location and layout. There are also more go-kart tracks. Like FSK, wait times are pretty much nonexistent here. I am also happy that the Fun Spots are open until midnight, which is usually 2 or 3 hours later than the big parks.</p>

<br><h2>Coasters</h2>
<p><b>White Lightning</b> has a similar thrill level and experience to Switchback at ZDT's. I prefer Switchback for its superior drop and restraints. On White Lightning, areas that have yet to be Titan-tracked are bumpy, namely the double up/double down, and the final hundred feet or so into the brake run, starting with the right turn. The parts of the layout that have Titan track are very smooth. I rode in all rows, and slightly liked the back more than the front. At 25 rides, this GCI now takes the title of my most-ridden coaster. White Lightning is an enjoyable woodie for families and thrillseekers alike, with several airtime moments, drops, and forceful turns. It is a bit bumpy though. So far, Mine Blower is still my favorite coaster at a Fun Spot park.  <br><br>

<b>Freedom Flyer</b> was a lot better than similar Vekoma family coasters with those bulky restraints. I'm talking about Kiddy Hawk, Flying Ace, Silver Streak, and Flying School. On Freedom Flyer, I did not have to ride defensively and could enjoy the ride. It's in a great location too, and pulls decent forces near the end. I elected to re-ride this coaster a couple times since it didn't beat me up. It's a wonderful introduction to the suspended configuration. I wish the old Vekoma family coasters could get the restraints that Freedom Flyer has.<br><br>

I have no comment on <b>Sea Serpent</b>.

</p>

<br><h2>Other Rides</h2>
<p>I rode FireCracker, Hot Seat, Liberty Swing, and Rip Curl once each. I liked <b>Hot Seat</b> the most, but wish it were longer. We only got two full swings before it ended. FSO also has fair rides, kiddie rides, and go-karts. There is a lot of overlap with the rides st FSK. </p>

<br><h2>Food & Merchandise</h2>
<p>I bought chicken tenders and fries from Kluckee for $11, and a huge piece of pizza from Sbarro for $5. I used my souvenir cup 8 times across my two visits to FSO. Combined with FSK, each fill cost me less than 80 cents. I love visiting the Fun Spot parks and not being gouged when it comes to buying food and drinks. </p>

<br><h2>Cost</h2>
<p>Since I had planned to visit all three Fun Spot locations in 2022, I purchased a season pass last November for $85. With three total visits to the Florida Fun Spots, admission cost me $28 each time. Check out the cost breakdown of my entire trip <a href="flcost22.html" style="color: #27F5CA;">here</a>. </p>
