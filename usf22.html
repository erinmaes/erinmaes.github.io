<h3>I only spent a half day at USF because I ran out of things to do. This park has nowhere near the ride lineup quality of its neighboring park. </h3><br>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Day 8 of my trip was split between Universal Studios Florida and Fun Spot Orlando. I visited USF from 9:30AM-2:30PM and rode Rip Ride Rockit 3 times, Gringotts once, and Woody Woodpecker once. Overall, I was disappointed with USF's attraction offerings. Even when the Mummy returns, this park still needs more thrill rides. I overetimated the amount of time I thought I needed here and left after 5 hours. There was limited shade here. Diagon Alley and RRR are currently the only reasons to visit USF. </p>

<br><h2>Coasters</h2>
<p> My favorite coaster at Studios was Maurer's <b>Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit</b>. It has some great airtime, intense moments, and a unique feature with song selection. The seats are comfortable too. However, the drop is shallow, the coaster is bumpy, and there's bad pacing with brakes everywhere. I rode in the very back and front rows. The back is better for speed and airtime. The line moved quickly, but has the dreadful mandatory locker policy that I detail in my <a href= "ioa22.html" style="color: #27F5CA;">Islands of Adventure</a> report.<br><br>

I rode <b>Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts</b> without 3D glasses but still enjoyed it. Somehow I missed picking them up in the single rider line. This ride felt really similar to Spider-Man at IOA but with a drop and a few more thrills. Forbidden Journey still gets the edge for its storyline and maneuvers. I loved the exterior of the Gringotts building and dragon. The locker area for this coaster was tiny and crowded. I might've gone back for another ride elsewise.<br><br>

I have no comment on Woody Woodpecker's Nuthouse Coaster.
</p>

<br><h2>Other Rides</h2>
<p>I rode E.T., The Simpsons Ride, and Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon. Simpsons was my favorite, but they were all good. Transformers was the only other ride I was interested in, but I didn't want to wait 1-2 hours. </p>

<br><h2>Food & Merchandise</h2>
<p>I bought a pizza-stuffed pretzel and water bottle at a refreshment stand for $12. It was tasty albeit messy. At the Universal Studios Store in CityWalk, I purchased 4 t-shirts, a mug, and a hat for $154 total. Most of this haul was for family members. The Universal Studios Store had a great selection of Harry Potter things, Marvel/Dr. Seuss/Jurassic Park apparel, Studios merch, trinkets, and other souvenirs. </p>

<br><h2>Cost</h2>
<p>The ticket option I went with was the 3-Park 3-Day Base Ticket with 2 Days Free promotion, which cost $354 total. I also received $200 off my 7-night hotel stay at Dockside Inn & Suites for bundling my ticket and room. I wouldn't have purchased a 5-day ticket if the bonus days hadn't been free. Two or three days is plenty of time for a solo coaster enthusiast to visit both IOA and USF. When EU opens, 5 days will probably be ideal.
