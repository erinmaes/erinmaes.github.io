<h3>On August 5, 2016, I visited La Ronde in Montreal for the first time. While I agree that Six Flags needs to show this park some love, my time spent here was positive and I don't think this place deserves as much hate as it often gets.</h3><br>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>My family visited La Ronde from opening until 6:30PM. We stayed in downtown Montreal, so we took the metro and a shuttle bus to get here. The park was moderately crowded and sunny. I got one ride on all of the roller coasters except for Marche du Mille-pattes, a kiddie coaster. Wait times ranged from 5 minutes to an hour. This was my first experience where the language of choice for most guests was not English, but we had already spent a week in Quebec so we were used to many people speaking French. Overall, La Ronde was run down. Their landscaping especially was pitiful and there were several abandoned spaces and buildings. However, all coasters were operating and (in 2016) there was a decent selection. </p>

<br><h2>Coasters</h2>
<p>There is not much to be said about <b>Toboggan Nordique</b>, a Zamperla wild mouse clone, <b>Le Boomergang</b>, a Vekoma Boomerang clone, or <b>Dragon</b>, an indoor Intamin family coaster. <br><br>Their B&M Batman clone, <b>Vampire</b>, did not open until late afternoon. When I was there, the train was running backwards. This "reverse" ride was a fun and different experience that I appreciated having ridden so many Batman clones forward. 

<br><br>I thought <b>Ednor L'Attaque</b>, a recycled Vekoma SLC from Six Flags AstroWorld, was alright. My dad and I rode it in the back and it was bumpy, but still enjoyable. It's partly located over water, which added extra thrills to this inverted coaster. Ednor's bulky restraints gave an expectable amount of head-banging. 

<br><br>The park had yet another Vekoma, a looper called <b>Super Manege</b>, which was mediocre. It desparately needed a new coat of paint, and the layout after the corkscrews was weak and slow. 

<br><br>La Ronde's Intamin stand-up coaster, <b>Le Cobra</b>, was decent. It ranks near the bottom of the stand-up coasters I've ridden because it only had one inversion and wasn't quite as smooth as newer versions. The coaster was photogenic, and it's a shame that the park scrapped it. 

<br><br>Surprisingly, the only coaster that left me disappointed on the day of my visit was <b> Le Goliath</b>, a B&M hyper coaster that's not really a hyper coaster because it's height and drop are around 170ft. However, the height did not disappoint me. Goliath is the one and only coaster that I've ridden with a virtual reality headset. My VR quit working (the screen went black) on the lift hill. So for the duration of the ride, I could not see anything. While I did not feel nauseous, I disliked my "blind" ride on Goliath. This coaster did have good speed and floater airtime, which is why it is solidly in my <a href="top50.html" style="color: #27F5CA;">Top 50 Coasters</a>, but I'm guessing that I would've liked it a lot better if it hadn't been for the VR disaster. 
<br><br>Re-rides on Goliath and <b>Le Monstre</b> would the only reason I'd consider heading back to La Ronde. Monstre looked like a beast and it delivered. It was only running one side, but it was arguably my favorite ride of the day. I was surprised by its speed. I cannot recall exactly what, but I later learned that this coaster holds some sort records for length and speed. Monstre is a fantastic coaster with a unique layout, a great length, and a charm that I can't quite explain. 

<br><br>All in all, the coaster collection at La Ronde was well-rounded and typical for a Six Flags park, but somewhat lacked in quality.    </p>

<br><h2>Other Rides</h2>
<p>In addition to coasters, La Ronde has a pretty standard collection of flat rides plus a log flume and shoot the chute. I did not ride any of them. I did, however, take the transportation ride, <b>Minirail</b>, several times. It stopped at the front and back of the park, which provided relief for sore feet as well as nice photo opportunities.</p>

<br><h2>Food & Merchandise</h2>
<p>My family only ate lunch at La Ronde. We chose Subway, located near Ednor. The quality of our food was normal for Subway sandwiches, and we only waited in line 10 minutes or so. I did buy a souvenir t-shirt with the park's skyline and major coasters on it. The gift shop had a good selection of merchandise for Six Flags, La Ronde, and the coasters.</p>

<br><h2>Cost</h2>
<p>We got discounted tickets for La Ronde by turning in Coca-Cola cans with coupons on them. Therefore, we paid $40 per person, which was $15 or $20 off the gate price. Food and drinks at the park were marked way up, as to be expected. My t-shirt cost $17, which I thought was fair.</p>
