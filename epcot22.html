<h3>It just so happened that my time at Epcot came six days after the opening of its first coaster. Luckily, I got to ride and loved my time at this "Disney for grown-ups" park. </h3><br>

<h2>Recap of my Previous Visit</h2>
<p>I visited Epcot for a full day on a weeklong family trip to Walt Disney World in 2006. This was probably my least favorite of the 4 parks in '06, as it severely lacked thrill rides. I waited two hours to ride Test Track and was devastated when it broke. I thought Spaceship Earth was kind of boring, and Soarin' was underwhelming. I enjoyed riding the monorail most.</p>

<br><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I "started" my Epcot halfday by pressing that infamous Join Queue button at precisely 7:00:00AM in the MDE app. Fortunately, my attempt was successful, and I was awarded boarding group 51 for Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind. I visited Epcot from 8:30AM-2PM, which was plenty of time to accomplish what I wanted to do. Admittedly, I only explored about 40% of this park, going as far to the left as Test Track and as far right as the International Gateway. I rode Test Track twice, Spaceship Earth once, Guardians once, and Soarin' once before park hopping to Hollywood Studios. Although outer space isn't a huge interest of mine, I enjoyed the futuristic theming of Epcot. The construction walls were very annoying though.</p>

<br><h2>Coaster</h2>
<p> I got the callback at 11:20AM to ride <b>Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind</b>. I don't typically discuss queues, but the one for this coaster was amazing. From the dark blue hues of the Galaxorium to the holographic characters to the epic pre-show, Cosmic Rewind delivered a pre-ride experience that had me pumped! The queue even smelled brand new. I wited about 45 minutes to ride. The loading sysyem for Cosmic Rewind is very efficient. This ride has speedy lift hills, a thrilling backwards launch, and cool spinning. Being inside makes it seem much faster, and the music probably also helps. I got "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" and think that song syncs perfectly with the ride! I can see how the spinning effects are disorienting for some riders, but I had a blast! This ride is not very intense, but it's engaging. Cosmic Rewind is my second-favorite attraction at WDW, only behind Rock 'n' Roller Coaster.  

</p>

<br><h2>Other Rides</h2>
<p><b>Test Track</b> could definitely be considered a thrill ride. It felt a lot like actual driving, but a bit more action-packed! My favorite part of course was the 60mph+ lap outside finale. I did the single rider queue both times and waited less than 10 minutes while the posted standby wait was an hour. The 3-across seating makes this ride an excellent choice for the single rider line. I'm glad I got to experience this attraction 16 years after being disappointed. I also enjoyed Spaceship Earth and Soarin' more than I did as a child. I will say that being in the bottom row on Soarin' and looking at feet ruined some of the magic. </p>

<br><h2>Food & Merchandise</h2>
<p>I had lunch at Sunshine Seasons. This meal was one of my favorites of the trip; I got the rotisserie chicken with green beans and potatoes. With a small bottled water, my total was $16. </p>

<br><h2>Cost</h2>
<p>I spent $392 on a two-day park hopper ticket with Genie+ and one IAS purchase. On this day, I saved all Genie+ selections for <a href= "dhs22.html" style="color: #27F5CA;">Hollywood Studios</a>. While it is extremely expensive to pay nearly $200/day for an individual to visit theme parks and skip a few lines, it took me 16 years as it was to get back to Disney World. It will likely be at least another 5 years before I return to Florida. While not packed with thrill coasters, the Disney parks are special...and worth every penny in my opinion.  </p>
