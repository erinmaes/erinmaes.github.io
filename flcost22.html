<h3>Notes & Analysis:</h3>
<p>The big revelation was that I spent almost as much money on merch as food/drink. This discovery totally makes sense though, as I ate breakfast at the hotel for free every morning, and bought my family members multiple gifts. Obviously, not buying merchandise would've been the easiest and most practical way to cut down the cost of my trip (by 8%) without skipping any parks or shortening my vacation. I also tipped all of my Lyft drivers nearly 25%, which is included in the amount above. While not a requirement, I highly recommend doing so. I split my trip between three middle-of-the-road hotels, and would not have wanted to downgrade to cheaper properties for safety and cleanliness reasons. Upgrading also would not have made sense since I spent less than 50% of my time in Florida in the hotel room. </p>
